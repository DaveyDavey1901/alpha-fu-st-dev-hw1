**PROJECT DETAILS**

A marketing agency required an exsiting site to be refatored to make it more accessible.

**What was done**

HTML

1. The Html elements were changed for sematic clarity i.e. divs were changed to section/article/nav/footer/header.
2. links were adjusted to ensure they worked, as well as alt tags added.
3. images were all resized to speed up load times as they were initially huge.
4. comments were added to make the code easier to read.
5. missing ids were added.
6. title tags added to the heart at the bottom of page.

CSS

1. comments were added... sections broken up with comments to make it easier to understand the code.
   as well as some notes for some of the code.
2. consolidated the css as much as i could do.
3. removed items that were irrelivant or not needed as they were doubled up.
4. set the font size in the body and removed it from the p element as it was 16px which is the browser default size.
   having it in the body means its easier to change later if we wanted to adjust it  
   to make it easier t work out rems and ems.
